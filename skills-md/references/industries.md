## For Other Industries

If the industry is not listed above, research the company to identify:

1. **Main business units** → Categories
2. **Customer-facing services** → Topics
3. **Decision-making process** → Journey stages

**Journey Stage Selection:**
- Use industry-specific stages when the customer experience has unique phases (e.g., travel with disruption events, healthcare with treatment phases, insurance with claims)
- Use generic stages (Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Retention) when the customer journey is straightforward
- Web search can reveal industry-standard journey frameworks

Follow the same pattern: 4-6 categories, 8-12 topics per category, mapped to appropriate journey stages (4-7 stages depending on industry complexity).
