# Adobe LLMO Prompt Library Reference

This reference is based on Adobe's official LLM Optimizer Industry Prompt Library. Use these examples as inspiration when generating prompts for different industries.

## Key Principles from Adobe Library

### Branded vs Non-Branded Mix
- **Branded prompts** (35-40%): Include actual company/brand name
- **Non-branded prompts** (60-65%): Generic queries without brand mentions

This mix is critical for GEO tracking - non-branded prompts test if your brand appears in AI responses organically.

### Use Real Brand Names
When generating prompts for a specific company, use their actual name:
- Branded: "What's the baggage limit for Iberia?"
- Branded: "How much does Repsol charge for electricity?"
- Non-branded: "Which airlines have the best baggage policies?"
- Comparative: "Is Telefónica better than Vodafone for mobile plans?"
